In this assignment, a disaster response simulation called **QuakeAssist** is implemented using **C++11**, focusing on the use of **dynamic queues and stacks** without STL containers. The system manages two global request queues: a **supply queue** for logistics tasks and a **rescue queue** for emergency rescue operations, both implemented as dynamically allocated **circular arrays**. Incoming requests are enqueued with detailed attributes such as ID, city, type, and emergency level. At each step, an **emergency decision engine** compares the front of both queues and selects the most urgent request based on a computed emergency score, ensuring that teams always handle the globally most critical situation rather than serving a single queue blindly.

Response teams are modeled with individual **mission stacks** that store assigned requests using a dynamically resized array structure. During the **HANDLE_EMERGENCY** operation, selected requests are pushed onto a team’s stack and contribute to the team’s total workload. If the workload exceeds the team’s predefined capacity, an **overload condition** is triggered and the entire mission is rolled back by popping all requests from the stack and returning them to their original queues in correct order. Successful missions are finalized with **DISPATCH_TEAM**, which clears the stack and prints a summary. The assignment emphasizes correct implementation of **FIFO and LIFO behaviors**, emergency prioritization logic, and robust **memory management** in a realistic crisis coordination scenario.
