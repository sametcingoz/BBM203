In this assignment, a **Rail Marshal System** simulation is implemented using **C++11**. The system models a railway classification yard where incoming freight wagons are organized by **destination** and **cargo type** using a **2D matrix of doubly linked lists (WagonList)**. Within each list, wagons are kept sorted in **descending order of weight**. When a train is assembled for a specific destination, all related wagon lists are merged into a single **Train** structure, while preserving cargo groupings. The order of cargo groups is determined by the heaviest wagon in each group, and **hazardous cargo is always placed at the end of the train**, with a maximum of one hazardous wagon allowed per train.

Assembled trains are transferred to the **Departure Yard**, which consists of one **TrainTrack queue per destination**. Trains are added from the rear and dispatched from the front following strict queue rules. The system processes commands from an input file such as **ADD_WAGON, ASSEMBLE_TRAIN, DISPATCH_TRAIN, PRINT_YARD, PRINT_TRACK, and AUTO_DISPATCH**. After assembly, **coupler load safety checks** are performed from tail to head; if a limit is exceeded, the train is split and the detached wagons form a new train. All data structures are implemented manually without using STL containers, emphasizing correct use of **dynamic memory management** and linked data structures.
